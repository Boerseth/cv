        description: |
          I started on the web front-end team (TypeScript, Redux) of the service Min Sky, but soon transitioned to a back-end role to participate in an API rewrite for the service Fremkalle (Python, PostgreSQL), before joining the core Min Sky back-end team in early 2020. Some years later I became responsible for the front- and back-end of the internal tool Bifrost (TypeScript, React).
