        description: |
          Started on the web-team (TypeScript, Redux) of the service Min Sky. Later joined a small team in rewriting the API of the service Fremkalle (Python, Falcon).

          Transitioned to more generic Min Sky-backend tasks, including statistics collection, feature development, maintenance, and helping customer service solve mysteries. Eventually took on the responsibility for both front- and backend of the internal tool Bifrost (TypeScript, React).
